# New BPM Orbit System in LEIR
This is the work presented in the Beam Instrumentation annual workshop in 2018 where I introduced all the software achievements for the LEIR accelerator.
**LEIR** stands by [Low Energy Ion Ring](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/low-energy-ion-ring), and is a particle accelerator at CERN used to accelerate ions from the LINAC 3 to the PS (Proton Synchrotron ) to provide ions for collisions within the LHC.
Here you can find the system installed for LEIR which allows to measure the positions of the bunched beam.


## Context
On the one hand in the ring orbit we needed to cope with an orbit upgrade (for LEIR) due to an obsolence of the current software so the calibration programs needed to be replaced; On the other hand the low intensity ion beams coming from LINAC3 urged an optimization in the injection line efficiency.


## Results
In the result presented we reported much more precision comparing the average of the orbit. As far as the standard deviation concerns and we could appreciate the results for the new system show much less noise. The data is more focused, and less spread out
